seq1 seq2 mismatch gap.open gap.extend,

seq1 is a file of one DNA sequence in FASTA format
seq2 is a file of one DNA sequence in FASTA format
gap.open is the gap open penalty (a non-negative integer)
gap.extend is the gap extension penalty(a positive integer)

base match scores=10

Program:
	reads 2 files

			where m & n <= 10,000
	prints report
		sections of 70 characters
		3 rows per section
			alignment
			value of four scoring parameters
			name and length of sequence
			similarity score of alignment
			length of alignment
			% identity
			# matches
			# mismatches
			total length of gaps
